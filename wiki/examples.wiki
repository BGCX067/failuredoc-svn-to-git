#summary Example document inferred by FailureDoc (experimental results)

= Overview =

We show a set of example document inferred by FailureDoc for the evaluation.

The following sections include subjects description, steps in reproducing the results, and sample tests.

Note that, FailureDoc uses a (pseudo) randomized algorithm to create the value pool. It may produce slightly different results in different environment (e.g., different JVM, available resource).


= Examples =

Code for running experiments is under the folder [http://code.google.com/p/failuredoc/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fexperiments experiments]. By default, all documented test is put into the folder `./failuredoc_output`
