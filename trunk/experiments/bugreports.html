<b>Status: </b> A developer confirmed that the bugs are real, but had been reported before. He also thought the inferred documentation was <i>useful</i>.

<br/>

<b>Note: </b> from the available developers' response, only these two bugs are previously-unknown. The remaining bugs reported in this page, to our best knowledge, had not been reported before.

<p><big>2 bugs in Apache Commons Math</big>

<b>Status: </b> A developer named Luc Maisonobe thought the inferred documentation was <i>useful</i>.  However, he thought the bugs, though expose potential failure in the code, are not true, and thus can not be fixed. Later, I submitted a possible fix (the same link above), asking for his feedback. Still waiting for his response.

<p><big>3 bugs in Apache Commons Collections</big>

Bug report URL 1 (contains 2 bugs): <a href= "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COLLECTIONS-374

<br/>
<b>Status: </b> A developer confirmed that indeed exists a bug, but the tested code was deprecated. So that the reported bug wont be fixed. He comments that the inferred documentation is not that useful, since the particular test was already simple enough. This concurs with the results of our controlled user study.
